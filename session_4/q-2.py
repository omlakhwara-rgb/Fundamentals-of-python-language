#2. Build a Python script that asks the user for their marks (0-100) and prints their grade based on this rule: 90+ = 'A', 75-89 = 'B', 60-74 = 'C', 40-59 = 'D', below 40 = 'F'. Use if, elif, and else.

marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))

if marks >= 90:
    print("A grade")

elif marks >=75 and marks <= 89:
    print("B grade")

elif marks >=60 and marks <= 74:
    print("C grade")

elif marks >=40 and marks <= 59:
    print("D grade")

else :
    print("F grade")
